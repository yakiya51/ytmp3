# ytmp3

warning: Currently, the audio file is downloaded as .mp3 but it is actully in webm or m4a format so some audio players will have difficulty playing the file. You'll have to convert it to mp3 using ffmpeg. File conversion may be added to this program eventually. 

Download the audio off YouTub video/playlist. Save default paths, preview thumbnails, and name files. Supports downloading audio of all videos in a playlist. 

If you want to use it:
- Make sure to create an empty folder called "temp". This where thumbnail previews are temporarily stored. 
- Run gui.py
