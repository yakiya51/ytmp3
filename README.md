# ytmp3

warning: Currently, the audio file is downloaded as .mp3 but it isn't actually a .mp3 so some audio players will have difficulty playing the file. This will be fixed eventually.


Download the audio off YouTub video/playlist as an mp3 file with a simple GUI. Save default paths, preview thumbnails, name files. Supports downloading audio of all videos in a playlist. 

If you want to use it:
- Make sure to create an empty folder called "temp". This where thumbnail previews are temporarily stored. 
- Run gui.py
